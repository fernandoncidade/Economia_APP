Project: Economia APP - Financial Calculator
Version: 0.0.2.0
Authors: Fernando Nillsson Cidade

Short description:
Economia APP is a support tool for studying Engineering Economics (course TT007) that automates common financial calculations — simple and compound interest, annuities, gradients, rate equivalence, amortization (SAC, Price, SAM), investment analysis (VPL / VAUE) and depreciation — and presents detailed steps and history of results.

Detailed description:
The application was developed to reduce time spent on manual re-checks and minimize calculation errors, providing:
- Tabbed interface by topic (Interest, Annuities, Gradients, Rate Conversion, Amortization, Investments, Depreciation).
- Output with detailed steps to facilitate understanding and review.
- Editable calculation history for recording and comparison.
- Generation of amortization tables and export to PDF.
- Support for different regimes and methods (end-period/beginning-period, simple/compound, SAC/Price/SAM, straight-line/sum-of-the-years-digits).

Main features:
- Simple and compound interest calculations (P↔F amount with step-by-step display).
- Annuities: calculation of payment (A) and present value (P) for end-period/beginning-period series.
- Gradients: arithmetic and geometric with applied formulas and steps.
- Conversion of effective rates between different periods (equivalence).
- Amortization: generation and visualization of tables (SAC, Price, SAM) with PDF export.
- Investment Analysis: VPL and VAUE with detailed calculation steps.
- Depreciation: straight-line and sum-of-the-years-digits methods.
- Calculation history with options to edit/remove/export.
- Translation support (pt_BR / en_US).

Installation and distribution (Windows):
1. Install Python 3.10+ (recommended).
2. In a terminal (PowerShell or cmd), create and activate a virtual environment:
   - python -m venv venv
   - venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies:
   - pip install PySide6
   (If there is a requirements.txt: pip install -r requirements.txt)
4. Run:
   - python main.py

Packaging (optional):
- To create an executable, use PyInstaller or a similar tool. Ensure inclusion of the assets and language/translations directories and EULA/ABOUT files.

Data storage and privacy:
- Settings and persistent files are saved locally in the user's directory:
  %LOCALAPPDATA%\Economia_APP
- Files may include language settings, history and auxiliary files (e.g., trial_info.json if the TrialManager is enabled).
- Logs generated by the application are available via the utils.LogManager module (see code in utils/LogManager.py).
- The application does not automatically transmit data to third parties. Any data submission for diagnostics or crash reports will be done only by user action (not automated by default).

System requirements:
- Windows 10/11 (or similar) with Python 3.10+
- PySide6 installed
- Minimum disk space: a few MBs (depending on assets)
- Write access to %LOCALAPPDATA% to save settings and logs

Quick start:
1. Open the application: python main.py (or executable).
2. Navigate through the tabs (Interest, Annuities, Gradients, Rate Conversion, Amortization, Investments, Depreciation).
3. Fill in numeric fields (use dot or comma; the app accepts comma and converts).
4. Click "Calculate" or "Generate Amortization Table".
5. View the history on the right; edit, copy or export as needed.
6. To export tables to PDF use the export option in the interface or the File menu → Export.

Common troubleshooting:
- "PySide6 not found" error: run pip install PySide6 in the active environment.
- Problems opening exported PDF: verify the save path is accessible and the filename ends with .pdf.
- Blank or invalid fields: fill all required fields; decimal numbers accept comma as separator.
- Write permission denied: ensure access to %LOCALAPPDATA% or run with appropriate permissions.
- Translations (.qm) do not appear: compile .ts with pyside6-lrelease (script language/trans_02_compileTranslations.py) and ensure the .qm files are present in language/translations.

Contacts and support:
- Author: Fernando Nillsson Cidade
- Support and contributions: open an issue or pull request in the project repository (see README / repository Git). For direct contact, see information in the repository (README/CONTACT).

License and notices:
- License terms and notices are available in the EULA and NOTICE files in the assets/EULA and assets/NOTICES folders (loaded by source/ui/ui_20_opcoes_sobre.py).
- Consult the included license files (EULA_pt_BR, EULA_en_US) before distribution.
- The application is provided "as is"; the author is not responsible for financial decisions made based on the program's outputs — use as a support tool and verify results.

Final notes:
- Economia APP was designed as a study and teaching aid for Civil Engineering students and professionals who need to validate economic calculations quickly.
- Contributions, improvement suggestions and bug reports are welcome to strengthen the tool's usefulness in the academic community.
- For developers: check the source code in source/ and the utils/ modules to understand where persistence, translation, logging and export are implemented.
