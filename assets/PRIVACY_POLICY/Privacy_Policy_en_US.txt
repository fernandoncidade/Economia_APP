Privacy Policy — Economia APP
Last updated: October 21, 2025
Version: 0.0.2.0

Summary
This Policy describes how Economia APP ("the Application") handles, stores and protects user data. The Application is designed to operate locally and, by default, does not send telemetry or user data to external servers.

1. Scope and principles
- Local operation: all data generated or handled by the Application remain on the user's device, except when explicitly exported/shared.
- Minimization: only data necessary for the features (calculations, history, export) are processed.
- Transparency: the user has full control over creation, editing, export and deletion of their data.

2. Data processed
2.1 User-entered data
- Numeric values used in calculations, history labels, note texts and display settings.
2.2 Files chosen by the user
- Files opened/selected for import or reading are read only upon user action.
- Exports (PDF) are saved to the location chosen by the user.
2.3 Local technical data
- Configuration files, history and logs may be written locally (e.g., history.json, trial_info.json when applicable, log files generated by utils/LogManager.py).

3. Storage location and retention
- Default persistence location: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Economia_APP
- The user may manually delete history, settings and log files. Data remain until the user removes them.

4. Telemetry, reporting and diagnostics
- The Application does not send telemetry automatically.
- If an option to send error reports or diagnostics exists, it will be presented clearly and requires the user's explicit consent prior to sending.
- Operating system reports (e.g., Windows Error Reporting) are generated according to system settings and are not controlled by the developer.

5. Data sharing
- No automatic sharing. Any transmission of data to third parties depends on explicit user action (for example: emailing an exported PDF or JSON).
- Third‑party libraries used locally (e.g., PySide6) are not used by the Application to transmit user data to external servers.

6. Security
- Data are under the user's control and protected by the device's operating system.
- The Application adopts basic measures (atomic file writes, error handling) to reduce the risk of data corruption, but does not replace backups. Regular backups of important files are recommended.
- There is no storage of remote credentials or authentication mechanisms by default.

7. Legal bases and rights (LGPD)
- Data processing occurs to perform functionalities requested by the user (implicit consent through local use).
- Data subject rights: access, correction, deletion and portability. The user may export their data (PDF/JSON) and manually delete local files.

8. Third parties, libraries and licenses
- The Application uses third‑party libraries for local functionality (e.g., PySide6 for the UI; other dependencies may include PDF/spreadsheet generation libraries when implemented). Those libraries remain subject to their licenses.
- License texts and notices are included in assets/NOTICES and assets/EULA.

9. Retention and deletion
- Data remain until the user deletes them. For complete removal, delete files in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Economia_APP.
- Logs and temporary files may be rotated or cleaned by internal features, if implemented; this will be communicated to the user when applied.

10. Children
- The Application is not directed at children under 13 years old and does not intentionally collect data from minors.

11. Changes to this policy
- Updates to this Policy will be recorded with a new date and version. Significant changes may be notified within the Application when applicable.

12. Contact
- Author / Data Controller: Fernando Nillsson Cidade
- Email for privacy-related matters: linceu_lighthouse@outlook.com
- For data deletion requests or questions about local processing, contact the email above.

Final note
Use Economia APP knowing that your data remain under your local control. For any integration involving data transmission, the Application will require explicit consent and clear instructions before proceeding.
