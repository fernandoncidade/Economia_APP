Packaging for distribution (tips)
- PyInstaller is recommended to create a Windows executable. Ensure inclusion of the assets/ and language/translations/ directories in the spec:
  - add assets/ and language/translations/ to the datas in the .spec
- Make sure to include license files (assets/EULA, assets/NOTICES, assets/COPYRIGHT, assets/CLC).
- If bundling PySide6 binaries, document LGPL compliance procedures as described in NOTICE_pt_BR.txt.

Compiling translations
- Generate .qm from .ts with pyside6-lrelease (or lrelease):
  - pyside6-lrelease language/translations/economia_pt_BR.ts -qm language/translations/economia_pt_BR.qm
- Place the generated .qm files in language/translations/ before packaging.

Data storage location
- Settings, history and generated files are saved at:
  %LOCALAPPDATA%\Economia_APP

Technical notes and dependencies
- Main dependency: PySide6 (LGPL v3 as per version).
- Check requirements.txt (if present) for additional dependencies.
- Logging: utils/LogManager.py (log files in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Economia_APP).
- Tests and validation: initial release — manual testing; adding automated unit tests for calculations is recommended for future releases.

Known issues (initial release)
- Some UI features partially implemented (some files in source/ui contain stubs to be completed).
- Translations need compilation (.qm) before packaging.
- Numeric input validation accepts comma/dot; review handling for edge cases (e.g., empty fields, zeros, negative values where invalid).

Roadmap / next steps
- Complete and test all UI modules and services (files with stubs in source/ui and source/services).
- Add unit tests for financial calculations.
- Improve PDF export and table layouts.
- Automate the build process and Windows installer generation.
- Implement opt-in telemetry for diagnostics (only with explicit consent).
