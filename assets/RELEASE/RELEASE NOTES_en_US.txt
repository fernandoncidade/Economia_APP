   - venv\Scripts\activate
   - pip install PySide6
3. Run in development:

Packaging for distribution (tips)
- PyInstaller is recommended to create a Windows executable. Ensure inclusion of the assets/ and language/translations/ directories in the .spec:
  - add assets/ and language/translations/ to the datas in the .spec
- Make sure to include license files (assets/EULA, assets/NOTICES, assets/COPYRIGHT, assets/CLC).
- If bundling PySide6 binaries, document LGPL compliance procedures according to NOTICE_pt_BR.txt.

Compiling translations
- Generate .qm from .ts with pyside6-lrelease (or lrelease):
  - pyside6-lrelease language/translations/economia_pt_BR.ts -qm language/translations/economia_pt_BR.qm
- Place the generated .qm files in language/translations/ before packaging.

- Tests and validation: initial version — manual testing; adding automated tests for financial calculations is recommended for future releases.

Known issues (initial release)
- Partially implemented UI features (some files in source/ui contain stubs to complete).
